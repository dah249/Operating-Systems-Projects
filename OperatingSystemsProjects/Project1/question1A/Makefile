#Description: program "pre.c" should read in a list of student names and their GPAs. To be simple, you can just input the  students' first names. Enter the inputs through the keyboard and display 
#the outputs on the screen.  The 
#inputs end when an EOF (generated by Ctrl-D) is encountered. The outputs of the program should display the students whose GPAs are above 3.0. 


# HOW TO RUN 
#To run the program get in the correct directory. type "make" to compile, then write make pre to run the program, then when you are done with the prompt write make clean to remove the executable.
