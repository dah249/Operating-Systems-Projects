For every program I wrote a makefile, and each Makefile. Under the "HOW TO RUN" section of the Makefile it shows you exactly how to run the code step by step. But I will add everything in here just 
in case.


Question 1A:
To compile use "make", to run the program use "make run", to clean the program use "make clean" to delete executables.

Question 1B:
To compile use "make", to run the program use "make run", to clean the program use "make clean" to delete executables.


Question 2:
To compile first run "make" to compile pre.c, sort.c, and pipe.c. Then type "make run" to run the program.You will not be prompted to enter the names and gpas. So after you run the code you have to 
type in the name and gpa. Then the program will figure out who has a gpa higher than 3.0 using pre.c and then sort the names using sort.c.  After the program is done running type "make clean" to delete the 
3 exe's.

Question 3:
Type "make" to compile the program then type any of the given commands, any unix command, or type "make run" to run the program with "./prog ls -t -l" unix command. Then to delete the executable 
type "make clean".
