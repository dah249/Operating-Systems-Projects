Lab 3   

Before writing this program, you can take a look at the example 'thread.txt' 
to understand how to create threads and use system calls to deal with mutual 
exclusion.

Simulate the concurrent execution of two threads using a single program:
Thread A: prints five subsequent lines of letter A on the printer and 
keeps looping (about 10 times).
Thread B: prints five subsequent lines of letter B on the printer and 
keeps looping (about 10 times).

Implement (a) and (b) using two programs, respectively:

(a) Do not use any algorithm for mutual exclusion and show the printout, 
which should be similar to this:

                             1: AAAAAAAAA
                             1: AAAAAAAAA
                            
                             1: BBBBBBBBB
                             1: BBBBBBBBB
                             1: BBBBBBBBB

                             1: AAAAAAAAA
                             1: AAAAAAAAA
                             1: AAAAAAAAA

                             1: BBBBBBBBB
                             1: BBBBBBBBB

                             2: AAAAAAAAA
                             2: AAAAAAAAA

                             .....................

In this printout, five lines of A or B have been interrupted. That means
mutual exclusion is not considered. Your output will be different from this 
one. But as long as you see one interruption of five lines of A or B, your 
output is correct. 

(b) Write the program again considering the mutual exclusion. Run the 
program several times to show that no five lines of A or B are interrupted.

To make longer execution of threads, use some sleep(n) functions in 
the program. Experiment with n to choose the best one to show the 
results.


                            1: AAAAAAAAA
                            1: AAAAAAAAA
                            1: AAAAAAAAA
                            1: AAAAAAAAA
                            1: AAAAAAAAA

                            1: BBBBBBBBB
                            1: BBBBBBBBB
                            1: BBBBBBBBB
                            1: BBBBBBBBB
                            1: BBBBBBBBB

                            2: AAAAAAAAA

Submission:

In order not to lose any file, you'd better zip all your files into a .zip file. 

Submit your project to CANVAS before the deadline. Homework will NOT be accepted through emails. 
You should write a readme textfile telling the grader how to run your programs. Without this file, 
it is very likely that your project will not be run properly.
